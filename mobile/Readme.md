To run this Project Just Download it and Run

## Getting Started

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/).

Then configure your development environment from the `.env.example` file and install the dependencies from your project’s `package.json` file by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Once your dependencies are installed, in order to run your application, execute the `start` command:

```
npm run start
```

After build your changes, you may use the `build` command to install it on your cellphone.

```
npm run anroid or npm run ios
```

Finally, the `publish` script starts your Expo "building server" on port [expo.io](http://expo.io).

```
npm run publish
```

That’s it! :rocket:
